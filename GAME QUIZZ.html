<h1><center>TECHNOLOGY TO EASE CHEMICAL EDUCATION</center></h1>

<br><br><br>

<h3><center>WHY IS CHEMICAL EDUCATION IMPORTANT??</center></h3>

<p><center><pre>Studying, in general, is important for numerous reasons and getting good marks is not the primary one.#

           In fact, studying not only boosts your educational development but also enhances various skills you need

           in life. When it comes to studying chemistry, many students consider the field somewhat irrelevant and think 

           that chemistry is not important enough to be explored. The truth is the complete opposite. Along with being 

           incorporated into our everyday lives, chemistry integrates multiple areas of science to solve a broad range of

           global issues.



           As chemistry is all about understanding different concepts and solving problems rather than learning random sentences

           by heart, it boosts various skills, including creative thinking. Besides, identifying and understanding concepts,

           doing research, and brainstorming are parts of studying chemistry, meaning that it also enhances your problem-solving

           skills.Just like many other sciences, chemistry incorporates multiple branches, each focusing on a particular aspect of

           chemistry.Studying chemistry enables you to understand different branches of chemistry, including inorganic chemistry, 

           organic chemistry, biochemistry, physical chemistry, environmental chemistry, and many more. Besides, if you ever decide

           to get a degree in biology or medicine, you will need to take chemistry as a prerequisite. Therefore, studying chemistry 

           not only educates you in that particular field but also prepares you to be more successful in other related courses.</pre></center></p><br><br><br><br>
